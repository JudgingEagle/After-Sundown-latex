After Sundown
=============

This is a PDF of the After Sundown RPG, developed by Frank Trollman
with assistance from members of
<a href="http://tgdmb.com/viewforum.php?f=1">The Gaming Den</a>.

I suppose people should consider this to be a "revised first edition"
of the game. The official first edition was released by Frank himself
via a torrent, but torrents can't be so easily updated after all so
this version here is a git repo, as you can see.

This edition of the book doesn't have any art other than the cover, and
is pretty plain visually. It's also got pages that are longer than
normal so that it can display more properly on a phone or tablet if you
want to use it as a quick reference during a game. Because it's setup
for mostly electronic viewing, I haven't worried as much where each
page break happens, so it might be a little harder to use if you print
it out.

Also, I've made some minor updates to different sections as typos or
bugs in the rules are noticed, or simply as people have suggested
modifications that could improve the rules a bit.
